Pseudo is a translator that allows CAIE students to practice writing code on a computer instead of on paper.

### Requirements

Pseudo translates pseudocode to Python, therefore the following are necessary:
* Python version 3.x ([click here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) for installation guide)
* A GUI that can run Python code (such as Visual Studio Code and Atom)

### Installation

* Fork or download this repository and save it locally on your machine
* Create a .txt or .psc file in the /Source Code/ folder
* The current default file name is 'console.psc' but you can rename it to anything else in main.py -> line 7
* Write down your pseudocode in the file you just created and run main.py to translate it and give an output!
