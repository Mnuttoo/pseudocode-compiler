![GitHub repo size](https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/shehryar37/pseudocode-compiler)

Pseudo is a translator that allows CAIE students to practice writing code on a computer instead of on paper.

## New Features!

  - ARRAY can now dynamically be assigned!
  - TYPE can be implemented


You can also:
  - Learn pseudocode through trial and error
  - Copy/paste pseudocode code online and check if it works

### Requirements

Pseudo translates pseudocode to Python, therefore the following are necessary:
* Python version 3.x
* A GUI that can run Python code (such as Visual Studio Code and Atom)

### Installation

* Fork or download this repository and save it locally on your machine
* Create a .txt or .psc file in the /Source Code/ folder
* The current default file name is 'console.psc' but you can rename it to anything else in main.py -> line 7
* Write down your pseudocode in the file you just created and run main.py to translate it and give an output!
